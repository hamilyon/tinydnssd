TinyDNSSD
=========

TinyDNSSD is a Java library for sending and receiving Multicast DNS packets to perform DNS Service
Discovery.

From Android 4.1, service discovery can be performed using the [NsdManager]. However some use cases
make use of the DNS TXT record to efficiently add extra key-value metadata, and Android has a
[bug] that causes the returned data to always be empty. This library can be used to work around this bug.

This library has an Android specific class, the `DiscoverResolver`, which still uses `NsdManager` to
leverage the system's already running discovery service, but will send another unicast query packet
in order to retrieve the TXT record. It also simplifies the API usage compared to calling `NsdManager`
directly.

Another feature is _service visibility debouncing_: sometimes [NsdManager] will signal
`onServiceLost()` then shortly afterwards report the same service in `onServiceFound()`. With this
library a tolerance to this can be configured - removed services are not notified to the client
until some time elapses without the service reappearing.

Usage
-----

```java
DiscoverResolver resolver = new DiscoverResolver(context, "_androidtvremote._tcp",
        new DiscoverResolver.Listener() {
    @Override
    public void onServicesChanged(Map<String, MDNSDiscover.Result> services) {
        for (MDNSDiscover.Result result : services.values()) {
            // access the Bluetooth MAC from the TXT record
            String mac = result.txt.dict.get("bt");
            String name = result.srv.fqdn;
            Log.d(TAG, name + " -> " + mac);
        }
    }
});
resolver.start();
```
